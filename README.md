Of the Gang of Four (GoF) designs I decided to start with the Factory Pattern. It seemed to be the best method to generate similar airplane objects. The idea moving forward is to expand this pattern to the passengers and airport resources as they are also similar within each class. While continuing development I am considering the Observer Pattern and State Pattern to fill the requirements.
